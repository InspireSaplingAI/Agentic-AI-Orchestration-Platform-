# Agentic-AI-Orchestration-Platform-
small-scale Agentic AI Orchestration Platform resembling an industrial production system

The project covers environment setup, modular backend service design, task planning, multi-tool integration, memory/retrieval, evaluation feedback loops, multi-agent collaboration, and deployment. Students will also implement APIs with FastAPI, design modular service layers, and practice monitoring, structured logging, and fault-tolerant execution pipelines. The final goal is a production-ready orchestration API capable of accepting complex tasks, decomposing them into subtasks, dynamically scheduling across multiple agents, and returning results via an interface with real-time tracking.
