# Agentic-AI-Orchestration-Platform
small-scale Agentic AI Orchestration Platform resembling an industrial production system

The project covers environment setup, modular backend service design, task planning, multi-tool integration, memory/retrieval, evaluation feedback loops, multi-agent collaboration, and deployment. Students will also implement APIs with FastAPI, design modular service layers, and practice monitoring, structured logging, and fault-tolerant execution pipelines. The final goal is a production-ready orchestration API capable of accepting complex tasks, decomposing them into subtasks, dynamically scheduling across multiple agents, and returning results via an interface with real-time tracking.


## Session 1: Project Kickoff & Basic Components
**Goal:** Simple agent with one tool, FastAPI setup, understand architecture.  

**Activities:**
- **Use Langroid:**
  - Start with a single agent example (`examples/hello_langroid.py`) to understand agent structure.  
  - Add a retrieval + Q&A agent using Langroid’s doc retrieval.  
- **Use FastAPI:**
  - Wrap the Langroid agent in a minimal FastAPI endpoint.  

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter Notebook or script running Langroid single-agent Q&A.  
- FastAPI endpoint exposing the agent.  
- Short report on **“agent + tool + API structure.”**

## Session 2: Multi-tool Agents, Memory & Scheduling
**Goal:** Multi-tool, task decomposition, context-aware memory, scheduling.  

**Activities:**
- **Use Langroid + CrewAI:**
  - Extend Langroid agent with multiple tools: retrieval + summarization + file writer.  
  - Add Langroid’s goal decomposition & planning logic.  
  - Integrate CrewAI roles (e.g., retrieval agent, summarizer agent).  
  - Implement context-aware memory (Langroid provides memory API).  

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-tool, multi-context agent system.  
- Logs of subtasks, tool usage, and scheduling traces.  
- Report comparing **single-tool vs multi-tool execution.**  

---

## Session 3: Feedback Loops & Multi-Agent Systems
**Goal:** Feedback, retries, fault tolerance, multi-agent orchestration.  

**Activities:**
- **Use CrewAI:**
  - Set up a multi-agent workflow (retrieval → summarizer → writer).  
  - Use CrewAI’s task orchestration & collaboration engine.  
  - Add feedback loops (failed summaries trigger retries).  
- **Use Agno:**
  - Add fault tolerance & structured logging for orchestration pipeline.  
  - Enable concurrent execution of multiple agents.  

**Deliverables:**
- Scripts showing multi-agent workflows with retry/feedback.  
- Logs & monitoring output.  
- Experimental results report (**feedback vs no-feedback, single vs multi-agent**).  

---

## Session 4: Deployment & Demonstration
**Goal:** Production-ready orchestration API with monitoring & cloud deployment.  

**Activities:**
- **Use Agno:**
  - Wrap orchestration engine in FastAPI with modular service layers.  
  - Add structured logging, monitoring hooks, and real-time task progress.  
  - Deploy with Docker + cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).  

**Deliverables:**
- Running FastAPI API with orchestration endpoints.  
- CLI or simple web UI demo.  
- Monitoring dashboard/log reports.  
- Cloud-deployed version (if infrastructure available).
